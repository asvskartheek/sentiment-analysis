Sentiment Analysis using Pytorch-Lightning

This is heavily inspired by bentrevett's [work](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis). I made this so that it becomes easier for people who are
new to NLP and pytorch-lightning, to get them going with a very basic framework to get started.

With this, you can
1. Train popular architectures to according to your hyperparameters (on IMDb dataset for now, planning to extend)
2. Train your own architecture. (Instructions on how this can be done will be added soon)
3. Use one of the pre-trained model, to just get the setiment prediction of the popular models.

## Pre-Trained Models Available
### 1. Simple RNN Classifier
### 2. Bi-Directinal LSTM Classifier
### 3. Fast Classifier
